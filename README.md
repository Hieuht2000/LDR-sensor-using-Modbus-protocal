# LDR-sensor-using-Modbus-protocal
NSL 19M51 sensor using MODBUS RS485 system



In this project, we will study and learn about embedded system design. We will also use the light intensity sensor to operate the system, 
and then transfer the data to a master device, with this project focusing on the LDR sensor. Then, we develop Modbus RTU frame using C programming language 
to connect the master device. 
After testing design the circuit on a breadboard and developing sensor code, we made the design of circuit using PADs logic and LTspice.
Finally, testing the data sent/received to the master device using Real Term.
